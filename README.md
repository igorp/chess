Chess engine
======

This is a playable chess engine written in C++ with a graphical user interface. It uses the allegro graphics library to display the graphics, minimax search algorithm to traverse the game tree and a simple board evaluation function to rank the different positions. This project is part of my Bachelor's Thesis at Tampere University.
