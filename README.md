Chess engine
======

This is a playable chess engine written in C++ with a graphical user interface. It uses the allegro graphics library to display the graphics, minimax search algorithm to traverse the game tree and a simple board evaluation function to rank the different positions. This project is part of my Bachelor's Thesis at Tampere University.

If you want to test out the engine yourself, then [here](https://homepages.tuni.fi/igor.podsechin/chess.zip) is a link to the zipped exe.
