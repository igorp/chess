Chess engine
======

This is a playable chess engine written in C++ with a graphical user interface. It uses the Allegro graphics library to display the graphics, minimax search algorithm to traverse the game tree and a simple board evaluation function to rank the different positions. This project is part of my Bachelor's Thesis at Tampere University, which you can read more about by here: https://trepo.tuni.fi/handle/10024/140588

If you want to try playing against the engine yourself, then [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/igorp/chess/master/chess.zip) is a link to the zipped exe. Good luck! :)
